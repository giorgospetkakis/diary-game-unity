The boat was washed ashore and it looked a bit beaten up._
Thankfully, it was light enough for me to move around, so I brought it underneath an overhang nearby._
I figures that’s the best place to keep it safe from weather, Moms, and pirates (it’s something to worry about here)._
Inside the boat I saw an envelope, and when I opened it said ‘Congrats on finding the boat!_
Whoever found this now owns the boat, and to avoid all this legal stuff here is my signature. Have fun!’_
which then had some scribbles at the bottom._
I then ran to the park and told Beatrice._

Oh I should probably tell you who that is._
Beatrice is one of my closest friends!_
I’ve known her about as long as I can remember and she’s always been around for me..._
well kind of_
it can be a little hard to tell sometimes but she’s the best._
She’s really smart and has awesome ideas, she can even take some of my ideas and make them waaay cooler._
That’s why I went to her, she would know just what to do with a washed up boat._

She was thrilled when I told her all about it and she thought that if it wasn't too beat up that we could restore it!_
I lead her back to the boat, drew some pictures of it, and decided to speak more tomorrow about it, because she also wanted to play back at the park._
I am excited to see what happens next with the boat.”_


Day 1 (Survival Sandwich)_


Dear Journal/Diary/Captain's log or whatever,_
Today, something exciting happened._
Well, exciting things tend to happen anyway, and I am already excited that it’s summer vacation._
It was more….unique….. UNIQUE exciting. That’s a good word for it._

As I was helping Mom make our celebratory waffles,  I noticed that there was a boat entering the cove by our house._
Mom was busy so she didn’t see it, and I didn’t want to tell here in case she got nervous or distracted. Plus I really wanted my waffles._

Over breakfast, while Mom was talking about how that now I am older I can go out but I need to be clear about what I am doing, not to assume what others think and do, and be responsible and blah blah blah, all I could think about was the boat._And the waffles._
After mom said another comment about making soure I was direct with people and to know what is safe and unsafe, she finished up and said if I wanted to I could walk to join my friends at the park._
I agreed so that I could get a chance to look at the boat. ‘Have a great day, May!” she said happily._

Later..._

I went to Beatrice’s for the day house to speak to her about what we need for the boat._
She that she drew up a plan, but she wanted to make some sandwiches first._
I got the ingredients by telling Mom that I Beatrice and Me that we were going on a picnic._
I guess that is true in a sense. Anyway when I got there Beatrice laid out the ingredients, and we got to work while she explained what she planned so far:_

“Make Sandwiches by dragging and dropping ingredients. You need at least one of each.  Put the bread on top to finish the sandwich”_

Beatrice was telling me ‘We should make some sandwiches for the trip. I think we need to make about 8 or so.’ So I started to put some together”
